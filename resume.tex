	\begin{description}
		\item[Probabilistic Person Matching] \hfill \\
		Designed and implemented a best in class application for determining the identities of patients seen in healthcare data.  The application is based upon a bayesian record linkage algorithm implemented in a Hadoop/Spark environment.
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item Runs over hundreds of millions of patients on a nightly basis
			\item 4 patents filed, 1 granted to date
			\item Finished in the top 10 of the ONC's patient matching challenge in 2017
		\end{itemize*}
		\item[Risk Modeling Framework] \hfill \\
		Designed and implemented a big data framework for implementing analytical models.  The framework enabled our data scientists to easily build and deploy complex analytical models.
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item Generates billions of risk scores on a nightly basis
			\item Built common routines to accelerate the implementation of new models
			\item Implemented dozens of analytical models in this framework
		\end{itemize*}
		\item[Claims Processing Pipeline] \hfill \\
		Designed and implemented an end to end process for ingesting claims data into our platform.  This process replaced a defunct one that left customers unhappy with inaccurate data and analytics.
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item Worked closely with customers to define requirements and success criteria
			\item Designed the data model used throughout the platform and applications
			\item Created automated ingestion routines and quality checks
			\item Implemented hundreds of claims based analytics
